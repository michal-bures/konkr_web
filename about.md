*Konkr* is a turn-based strategy game that runs directly in web browser.

The game is completely free to play and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

The game is built on HTML5, taking advantage of:

* [Phaser](//phaser.io), a javascript game framework that can operate over HTML5 Canvas or WebGL as needed
* [Babel](//babeljs.io) for unlocking the latest and greatest in javascript syntax
* [Webpack](//webpack.github.io/) webpack for putting everything together
* [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/) for maintaining this quaint little website around it 
* [Netlify](//www.netlify.com/) for publishing the website here for the world to see
