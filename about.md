## ...the game

*Konkr* is a turn-based strategy game that runs directly in web browser (it's also yet another  shameless bastardization of english language in pursuit of a searchable product name, for which I deeply apologize).

The game is completely free to play and will stay so for the foreseeable future.

The core game mechanics are heavily inspired by an aged but still briliant game called Slay. The plan is to immensely expand on its basic concept.

## ...the developer

My name is Michal Bure≈°. Michal is the czech equivalent of Michael/Mike, so feel free to call me any of that. 

*Konkr* is a little passion project of mine and currently occupies most of my spare time. When I'm not buried in code, I also enjoy playing video games of all kinds, and occasionally even some activities not constrained to the digital world (like backpacking, downhill skiing, soccer, squash).

If you'd like to chat about the game or whatever, lob me a mail!

## ...the technology used

The game is built on HTML5, using a bunch of awesome free technologies:

* Phaser, a nifty game making framework that can operate on HTML5 Canvas or WebGL
* babel for unlocking the latest and greatest in javascript syntax (ES2016)
* webpack for putting it all together
* jekyll for easily whipping up this quaint little website around it 
* netlify for painlessly publishing the website here for you to see
