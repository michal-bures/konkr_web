## What's this?

*Konkr* is a free strategy game that runs in your web browser. It's far from being finished, but I think it's already kind of fun. Give it a try!

## How to play?

The island is divided among four factions, each represented by different colour of the hexagonal tiles. Adjacent tiles of the same colour form a *Kingdom*. Each kingdom has it's own, independent economy. It gains *gold* each turn based on it's size and pays upkeep for any military units it owns. As tiles change ownership, new kingdoms rise and fall, merge together or split apart.

You are in control of all kingdoms belonging to the dark green faction and your goal is to bring  lasting peace to the land. Of course, you achieve this noble goal by mercilessly crushing all oposition under the heels of your armies! Here are some basic tips to get you started:

* Use the gold of your kingdoms to buy *soldiers* and *towers*.
* Use your soldiers to criple and eventually conquer all kingdoms of oposing factions.
* Use soldiers and towers to protect neighbouring tiles from enemy conquest.
* Your basic militia can only attack undefended territory. Buy more advanced units or upgrade your existing ones by merging them together. Then you'll be able to overcome stronger defenses.   
* Beware that unlike towers, soldiers have an anual upkeep cost, which reduces the kingdom gold income. More advanced soldiers cost much, *much* more upkeep than your basic militia!
* Make sure you always have enough gold to pay the upkeep of your soldiers. When not paid properly, all soldiers in the kingdom will instantly and irreversibly become *bandits* and start looting your kingdom! Conversely, you can try to cripple the economy of oposing kingdoms and hus turn their own armies against them!

Please do let me know, any and all feedback is much appreciated! Throw me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:mike@konkr.io">mike@konkr.io</a> or hit me up on [twitter]. Your feedback might affect in what direction the game will evolve next! 

## What's next?

Right now, <i>Konkr</i> is little more than a bare skeleton of a game. My first priority is to get it into a reasonably polished state, which means:

* better enemy AI
* improved graphics, sound and user interface
* adding more character to the game (proceduraly generated names for the kingdoms, assign name and basic lore to each faction)
* a basic multiplayer "metagame" (scoreboards, daily/weekly challenges)

After that I'll be experimenting with the gameplay formula and expanding it in whichever ways turn out to be most fun. Just for an example, here are some possible directions I've been considering:

* add diverse gameplay affecting "terrain" features (mountain ranges, volcanoes, forests, ...) 
* slightly different playstyle for each faction (unique units/bonuses etc.)
* basic diplomacy and relations (trust, grudges) between kingdoms
* map editor, replay sharing
* hand crafted challenge missions in the form of story-driven singleplayer campaign
* actual real-time multiplayer
