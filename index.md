## What's this?

*Konkr* is a free strategy game that runs in your web browser. It's far from finished, but I think it's already kind of fun. Give it a try!

**Controls** are really simple:

* Click on a pawn to pick it up. Click again to drop it. You can drop pawns on your territory, on enemy territory and even on other pawns. Try it and see what happens!
* Click the green button to end your turn.
* You can also right-click anywhere to undo your latest action.

## How to play?

The island is divided among multiple factions, each represented by different colour of the hexagonal tiles. Adjacent tiles of the same colour form a *Kingdom*. Each kingdom has it's own, independent economy. It gains *gold* each turn based on it's size and pays upkeep for any military units it owns. As tiles change ownership, new kingdoms rise and fall, merge together or split apart.

You are in control of the dark green faction with all its kingdoms. Your goal is to bring a lasting peace to the land by mercilessly crushing all oposition under the might of your armies. Here are some basic tips to get you started:

* Use the accumulated gold in your kingdoms to buy *soldiers* and *towers*.
* Use your soldiers to criple and eventually conquer all oposing kingdoms.
* Use soldiers and towers to protect neighbouring tiles from enemy conquest.
* Your basic militia can only attack undefended territory. Buy more advanced units or upgrade your existing ones by merging them together. Then you'll be able to overcome stronger defenses.   
* Beware that unlike towers, soldiers have an anual upkeep cost, which reduces the kingdom gold income. More advanced soldiers cost much, *much* more upkeep than your basic militia!
* Make sure you always have enough gold to pay the upkeep of your soldiers. When not paid properly, all soldiers in the kingdom will instantly and irreversibly become *bandits* and start looting your kingdom! Conversely, you can try to cripple the economy of oposing kingdoms and hus turn their own armies against them!

## What's next?

Right now, <i>Konkr</i> is little more than a bare skeleton of a game. My first priority is to get it into a reasonably polished state, which means:

* better enemy AI
* improved graphics, sound and user interface
* adding more character to the game (proceduraly generated names for the kingdoms, assign name and basic lore to each faction)
* a basic multiplayer "metagame" (scoreboards, daily/weekly challenges)

After that I'll be experimenting with the gameplay formula and expanding it in whichever ways turn out to be most fun (possible directions include diplomacy, terrain, natural events, more complex warfare and even rpg elements).
