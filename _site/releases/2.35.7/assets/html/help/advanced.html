                <li>When a province has more than one town, the <b>coins in all towns are pooled together</b> for
                    purchasing units, but the coins are still stored in the individual towns.
                </li>
                <li>When collecting income, new coins produced by each tile first go to the closest unit that wasn't paid
                    yet, then to the closest town.
                </li>
                <li>When you recruit a new unit, its cost is paid from the closest towns coin stack first (based on
                    where you placed the unit). This means that you can control which town will pay for a new unit by
                    choosing where to place it!

            <p><i><b>This is an in-depth guide to bandit mechanics.
                For a basic introduction see <a href='how-to-play.html#bandits' />Stranded units</a>.</b></i></p>

            <p>Bandits act at the end of each turn (after all other factions made their move).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If standing on a colored tile that doesn't belong to any province, they will loot 1 coin from the tile
                    and turn the tile neutral.
                </li>
                <li>Otherwise they will randomly move to an adjacent tile, preferring colored tiles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other useful things to know about bandits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are weaker than villagers and do not defend tiles.</li>
                <li>They cannot cross walls</li>
                <li>When standing on colored tile inside a province with town, they siphon the income from the tile to
                    the nearest camp, denying it to the province. Having many bandits in your province can <b>severely
                        undercut your economy!</b></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Any coins looted by bandits are <b>deposited in the nearest bandit camp</b>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If there's no bandit camp in a 5 tile radius and there's a neutral tile available somewhere on the
                    map, a new camp is spawned there.
                </li>
                <li>A bandit camp has the same defense as town or villager, but it does not protect adjacent tiles.</li>
                <li>If at least 3 coins are stored in the bandit camp, it will consume them produce a new bandit once per turn.</li>
                <li>You can destroy the camp with a pikeman or a stronger unit to claim any coins currently stored there!</li>
            </ul>

            On some islands, you might encounter unfamiliar objects or discover that the rules don't work quite the way
            they normally do. Some islands may even challenge you with objectives other than to vanquish all rivals (heresy, I know!).

            <ul>
                <li><b>Hover the mouse pointer over a tile or a unit</b> (or tap it on a touch screen) to reveal a tooltip with more information.</li>
                <li>Press <b>Escape</b> while playing to review the list of active objectives and rule modifiers.</li>

            </div>
            <p>The game has a number of subtle visual cues that can help your read the map faster:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wonder if a particular rival can afford a pikeman next turn? Look at the size of their town - each town level corresponds to the strongest unit tier predicted to be obtainable in the province on the next turn. For example if there's just a <img class='inline-icon' src='./img/icons/town.png'>tiny house, they should only be able to afford a villager.</li>
                <li>Notice the semi-transparent shield icons around the units you place - they give you an overview of the current defense for every tile in the selected province.</li>
                <li>A green flag in front of a town signals that you have enough gold in treasury to recruit another villager.</li>
                <li>A red flag in front of a town signals negative income.</li>
                <li>A black flag in front of a town signals an impending rebellion.</li>
                <li>A black flag in front of a bandit camp signals that it is about to spawn a new bandit.</li>
            </ul>

    </div>
    <div class='page' id='difficulty-modes' data-title='Difficulty Modes'>
        <div class='slide-content'>
            <p>In most <b>campaign</b> levels you can select from two difficulty modes which affect the rival rulers behavior:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On the <b style='color: darkred'>Hard</b> difficulty, rivals behave towards you exactly the same as to each other.</li>
                <li>On the <b style='color: darkgreen'>Normal</b> difficulty, you are given a few advantages to make the game less brutal:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rivals won't start to dislike you just because you've grown too large.</li>
                        <li>Rivals are less likely to figure out elaborate attacks deep into your territory.</li>
                        <li>Rivals will never become allies with each other.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the <b>conquest</b> mode, there are four difficulty modes which affect both map layout and the rival behavior:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Casual</b> = easier starting position + normal rivals</li>
                <li><b>Normal</b> = normal starting position + normal rivals</li>
                <li><b>Challenging</b> = normal starting position + hard rivals</li>
                <li><b>Unfair</b> = worse starting position + hard rivals</li>

            </div>
            <p>Zombies operate similar to bandits, but:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If there's an adjacent unit, the zombie will turn it into another zombie!</li>
                <li>Normal zombies can't move or infect units through walls.</li>
                <li><b>But</b> when a zombie has nowhere else to go, it may build itself a ladder and cross over unmanned walls on the next turn!</li>
                <li>Zombies can never infect <img class='inline-icon' src='./img/icons/castle.png'>castles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Haunted towns produce a new zombie every turn. To win a map with zombies, you need to not only defeat
                your rivals, but also <b>clear all haunted towns!</b></p>

    <div class='page' id='necromancers' data-title='Necromancers'>

            </div>
            <p><b>Necromancers</b> are very different from traditional rivals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They rely on <a href='#zombies'>zombies</a> to expand their territory.</li>
                <li>Eventually, they can spawn powerful <b>Dread Knights</b>.</li>
                <li>They are vicious but predictable. They always blindly attack the most obvious target and have no diplomatic relations with anyone.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Necromancer Lairs</b> are somewhat similar to <img class='inline-icon' src='./img/icons/town.png'>towns, but with some major differences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They don't gather coins, instead they collect <b>mana</b>.</li>
                <li>When a <b>zombie is destroyed on Necromancer's territory</b>, the closest connected Lair <b>gains 1 mana</b>.
                <li>If a Lair or a Haunted Town cannot spawn a zombie, it also generates 1 mana for the nearest Lair.</li>
                <li>Once a Lair has accumulated 6 mana, it will spawn a <b>Dread Knight</b> on the Necromancers turn. The mana is then allocated to maintaining the Dread Knight until it's destroyed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Dread Knights</b> are elite undead soldiers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are as strong as regular <img class='inline-icon' src='./img/icons/knight.png'>Knights and can move freely across the Necromancers province.</li>
                <li>They need no coin upkeep, but they require a Necromancers Lair with a full mana reserve to maintain their existence.</li>
                <li>Cutting them off from the Lair <b>instantly turns them into a regular zombie</b>.</li>
            </ul>
