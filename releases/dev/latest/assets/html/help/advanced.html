                <li>When a province has more than one town, the <b>treasury of all towns is pooled together</b> for
                    purchasing units, but the coins are still stored in the individual towns.
                </li>
                <li>When collecting income, new coins produced by each tile first go to the closest unit that wasn't paid
                    yet, then to the closest town.
                </li>
                <li>When you recruit a new unit, it's cost is paid from the closest town's treasury first (based on
                    where you placed the unit). This means that you can control which town will pay for a new unit by
                    choosing where to place it!

            <p><i><b>This is an in-depth guide to bandit mechanics.
                For a basic introduction see <a href='how-to-play.html#bandits' />Stranded units</a>.</b></i></p>

            <p>Bandits act at the end of each turn (after all other factions made their move).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If standing on a colored tile that doesn't belong to any province, they will loot 1 coin from the tile
                    and turn the tile neutral.
                </li>
                <li>Otherwise they will randomly move to an adjacent tile, preferring colored tiles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other useful things to know about bandits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are weaker than villagers and do not defend tiles.</li>
                <li>They cannot cross walls</li>
                <li>When standing on colored tile inside a province with town, they siphon the income from the tile to
                    the nearest camp, denying it to the province. Having many bandits in your province can <b>severely
                        undercut your economy!</b></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Any coins looted by bandits are <b>deposited in the nearest bandit camp</b>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If there's no bandit camp in a 5 tile radius and there's a neutral tile available somewhere on the
                    map, a new camp is spawned there.
                </li>
                <li>A bandit camp has the same defense as town or villager, but it does not protect adjacent tiles.</li>
                <li>If at least 3 coins are stored in the bandit camp, it will consume them produce a new bandit once per turn.</li>
                <li>You can destroy the camp with a pikeman or a stronger unit to claim any coins currently stored there!</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p>The game has a number of subtle visual cues that can help your read the map faster:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wonder if a particular rival can afford a pikeman next turn? Look at the size of their town - each town level corresponds to the strongest unit tier predicted to be obtainable in the province on the next turn. For example if there's just a <img class='inline-icon' src='./img/icons/town.png'>tiny house, they should only be able to afford a villager.</li>
                <li>Notice the semi-transparent shield icons around the units you place - they give you an overview of the current defense for every tile in the selected province.</li>
                <li>A green flag in front of a town signals that you have enough gold in treasury to recruit another villager.</li>
                <li>A red flag in front of a town signals negative income.</li>
                <li>A black flag in front of a town signals an impending rebellion.</li>
                <li>A black flag in front of a bandit camp signals that it is about to spawn a new bandit.</li>
            </ul>

    <div class='page' id='difficulty-modes' data-title='Difficulty modes'>
        <div class='slide-content'>
            <p>In most <b>campaign</b> levels you can select from two difficulty modes which affect the rival rulers behavior:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On the <b style='color: darkred'>Hard</b> difficulty, rivals behave towards you exactly the same as to each other.</li>
                <li>On the <b style='color: darkgreen'>Normal</b> difficulty, you are given a few advantages to make the game less brutal:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rivals won't start to dislike you just because you've grown too large.</li>
                        <li>Rivals are less likely to figure out elaborate attacks deep into your territory.</li>
                        <li>Rivals will never become allies with each other.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the <b>conquest</b> mode, there are four difficulty modes which affect both map layout and the rival behavior:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Casual</b> = easier starting position + normal rivals</li>
                <li><b>Normal</b> = normal starting position + normal rivals</li>
                <li><b>Challenging</b> = normal starting position + hard rivals</li>
                <li><b>Unfair</b> = worse starting position + hard rivals</li>
            </ul>

    <div class='page' id='zombies' data-title='Zombies'>

            </div>
            <p>Zombies operate similar to bandits, but:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If there's an adjacent unit, the zombie will turn it into another zombie!</li>
                <li>Zombies can't normally cross or infect through walls.</li>
                <li>A zombie <b>can</b> cross a wall when it has nowhere else to move and the tile on the other side of
                    the wall is free.
                </li>
                <li>Zombies can never infect <img class='inline-icon' src='./img/icons/castle.png'>castles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Haunted towns produce a new zombie every turn. To win a map with zombies, you need to not only defeat
                your rivals, but also <b>clear all haunted towns!</b></p>
