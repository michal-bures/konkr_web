<b>The short version:</b>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 16px">
 <li>
  If you give me your <b>email address</b> (on the feedback form or when you sign in), I keep it safe. That is:
  <ul>   
    <li> I will <b>only</b> use it for the purpose for which it was provided. </li>
    <li> I will <b>not</b> use it for any marketing or advertising purposes without your express consent.</li>
    <li> I will <b>not</b> share or sell it to any third party that could use it for marketing purposes.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Other than the email, I don't collect or store any other personally identifiable information. </li>
 <li>I do collect <b>anonymized gameplay metrics</b> and <b>crash logs</b> when you play the game. These do not include any personally identifiable information.</li>

</div>


### 1. What is collected

1.1 The **email address** you provide when you sign in or enter it in the in-game feedback form. 
 
1.2 **Anonymized usage metrics** and **Crash logs**, which may include:
    
  * information about your actions in the game 
  * statistics about your gameplay (total playtime, levels completed, etc.)
  * approximate geolocation based on your IP address (however IP address itself is not collected)
  * your browser language, time zone, OS, window size and other technical information
  * they do **not** contain any personally identifiable information
 
### 2. Why is it collected

2.1 **Email address** is collected for the following purposes:
 
 * When you provide your email address while signing-up or when you sign-up through a third party provider (such as Google or Facebook),
     your email address is used in the sign-in process and stored at the user database.
 * When you provide your email address in the in-game feedback form, I may contact you with to answer your question 
   or ask for additional information regarding your feedback. 
 * The game may allow you to subscribe to notifications about major game updates.
 If you opt into this service, announcements about major updates of the game may be sent to your email address.
 * Your email address will not be used for any other purposes than the ones listed above.

2.2 **Anonymized usage metrics** are collected, because they offer valuable insight into the way real users interact
     with the game. This in turns allows me to improve the user experience, balance game difficulty and in general make more informed
     design decisions when improving the game.

2.3 **Crash logs** are sent automatically when an unexpected error is encountered and you see a red error notification popup. 
     This helps me detect, reproduce, analyze and hopefully fix bugs in the game.
