<h1>Konkr</h1>
<p class='subtitle'>A turn-based strategy game by <a href='mailto:dev@konkr.io' target='_blank'>Michal Bure≈°</a></p>
<p>
 Inspired by the brilliant simplicity of <a href='https://www.windowsgames.co.uk/slay.html' target='_blank'>Sean O'Connor's "Slay"</a>,
 this game is a love letter to the concept of "easy to learn, hard to master". It's designed to be as simple, fast and intuitive to play
  as possible, yet to still offer much of the strategic depth you would expect from a grand strategy game.
</p>

<p>The strategy in Konkr is all about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing your allies and enemies wisely and launching decisive attacks at the right moment</li>
  <li>Balancing the economy and the military</li>
  <li>Outmaneuvering your enemy while protecting your own supply lines</li>
  <li>Allocating your military power between offense, defense and dealing with domestic unrest</li>
</ul>
