## What's this?

You're playing a legacy version of [Konkr](https://www.konkr.io).

The sequel should be superior to this version in all aspects, so you should probably [go play that](https://www.konkr.io)!

Or do you actually prefer this old version? If so, I would love to know why, so that I could use it to improve the sequel.
So, please, let me know!
