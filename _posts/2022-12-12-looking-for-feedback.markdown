I'm finally quite happy with the current state of the new AI!

**[GO MESS WITH IT HERE](https://www.konkr.io/releases/dev/test-ai-update/)** and let me know what you think! A more structured 
feedback survey will be coming up shortly.

It's also where you find the new levels for this week ðŸ˜‰.

Coming up next in the AI update branch:
- overhaul of the diplomacy layer (how your actions affect relations with other players)
- looking into ways to scale back the difficulty so that players looking for more relaxed gameplay aren't totally left behind ðŸ™‚
