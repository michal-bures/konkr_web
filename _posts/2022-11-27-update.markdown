You can now play against the in-development version of the new AI [over here](https://www.konkr.io/releases/dev/test-ai-update/)!
It still has a few major blindspots at the moment and may act a bit drunk, but I'm already having a blast playing against it, so might as well share! 

It may play a bit *too* well in some aspects, don't expect all campaign levels to be beatable in the test branch!
Do expect a proper beta test by next week, when I'm done fitting the few remaining pieces and ironing out a bunch of bugs.
