The AI rivals in the **[test branch](https://www.konkr.io/releases/dev/test-ai-update/)** are now much better at noticing when you're actively leaving them alone and appreciate
you for the benevolent neighbour you are (or at least feel slightly more guilty while invading 😉).

* There's also a **[Short feedback survey](https://forms.gle/W7xgbGW5Q6UFLR7Z8)** about the AI changes, have your say!
* You can now also read about the different AI personality presets [over here](/update/2022/12/19/about-ai-presets.html).
