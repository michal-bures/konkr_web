...along with rebalanced campaign and a number of new levels!

You should suddenly find the AI rivals to be much more cunning, diligent, but also less unhinged
and hopefully more fun to play against. **[Let me know what you think!](https://forms.gle/1d3mQZ6KMgBmdF9q7)** (survey link).

I will continue to tweak the AI in the coming weeks (there's still some known issues), 
but I'm also eager to move on to new exciting features, more info on those plans shortly!

*<b>Beware</b>: Due to changes in level generation, old conquest map links are unfortunately not compatible
with this version of the game. If you want to replay some old favourite maps, you can still play them on the older version of the game [over here](https://www.konkr.io/releases/2.5.17/).*
