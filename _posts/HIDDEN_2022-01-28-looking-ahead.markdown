## On the topic of the new AI

First of all, let's have a small detour to reflect on some concerns I've seen this week regarding the new AI:

**1. It's too slow**

To some extent this is an inevitable tax for it's new capabilities. And while it seems
that most of you are ok with paying it, I can and will definitely improve this, I don't want to 
leave any people with weaker devices or limited patience behind.

I would say on small maps the current speed of the AI is more or less what you'll get,
but on large maps you should see some major improvements in the coming weeks. 

**2. It's too hard**

Yes, the game needs a difficulty selection. "Easy to learn, hard to master" has always been my mantra with Konkr 
and with this update I'm rally leaning into the "hard to master" part. But I realize not everyone wants this to
be the Dark Souls of turn-based strategy games. If you just want a casual satisfying experience without having 
to meticulously analyze every move, rest assured I'm not planning to leave you behind either!

I'm planning adding difficulty selection as part of a much larger UI overhaul, more on that below. This means it will
take some time, so hang tight, but rest assure it is coming.

This will also nicely synergize with the previous issue, because the easier AI will be also able to play much faster,
hopefully at least on par with the old AI.

**3. It's sometimes too defensive for it's own good**

This is very visible in some 1v1 campaign maps where both the AI and the player get a lot of space to expand into. 
The AI can expand rapidly as long as it doesn't see any threat, but once it gets closer to confrontation,
it dedicates too much units to preventive defense, letting the player easily outexpand it. I will try to improve this
in the coming weeks, hopefully without making the AI *too* reckless again.
