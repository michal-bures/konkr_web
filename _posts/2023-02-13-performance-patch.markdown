## Poll results

Big props to all of you that made it all the way through the [big roadmap update post](/update/2023/01/29/roadmap-update.html) and discovered the poll link! â™¥

Here is what the responses look like:

My main takeway is that you are pretty excited about all three pillars of the content overhaul (new campaign, new conquest and map editor), so
there's no need to strongly prioritize any one of them in praticular. I think the order will be mostly Campaign â‡¨ Map Editor â‡¨ Conquest, 
but we'll see what makes more sense technically and what I feel like working on ðŸ™‚.

But as outlined in the previous update, in the next few weeks expect some more AI tweaks and the replay functionality to be the focus.
