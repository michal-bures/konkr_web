Neither can now move over walls! This gives you a bit more power to manipulate bandit movement.
Some subtle UX improvements were added too, for example you can now shift-click to quickly place multiple units!

For other news see [changelog](/changelog) and if you miss the zombies already, the infected version of the game is quarantined [over here](https://www.konkr.io/releases/2.5.3/).
