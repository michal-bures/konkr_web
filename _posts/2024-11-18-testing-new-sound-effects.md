No more looting coins and smacking fools in awkward silence! I'm experimenting with adding some long time missing sound effects to Konkr in the **[test branch](https://www.konkr.io/releases/dev/test-sound-effects/)**, and I'm hungry for your feedback!

<!-- excerpt-end -->
As always, you can send it via the in-game feedback button, or on [discord]({{ site.discord_link }}).

## About the test branch
When you visit the **[test branch](https://www.konkr.io/releases/dev/test-sound-effects/)**, you will be thrown into an in progress match, 
allowing you to quickly explore the new sounds. But you can also exit out and play as usual for a more realistic evaluation.

Also, in the top left corner, you get a control panel that lets you experiment with swapping some sounds for different alternatives. The new sound effects include:
- `conquerUnit` - the impact sound played when you bump into another players pawn while attacking
- `conquerBuilding` - the impact sound played when you bump into another players building (town/castle) while attacking
- `dodge` - played when an enemy pawn successfully retreats from your attack
- `grabCoins` - played when you loot some coins from a town or chest
- `grabManyCoins` - played instead of `grabCoins` when you loot over 20 coins from a town or chest
- `depositCoins` - played when coins land in your town
- `spawnCoins` - played when some coins spawn at the start of your turn
- `spawnManyCoins` - played instead of `spawnCoins` when at least 10 coins spawn for you at the start of your turn

Most of the available alternatives are things I tried and dismissed before landing on the current setup, but if you find some of them
particularly awesome, don't hesitate to lobby for them! 

Same if you have an entirely different idea what kind of sound effect would be the best fit. I've listened to so many
different thuds and whooshes and jingles this weekend it's making me a bit dizzy, but I'm still on the lookout for discovering those rare
bits of audio feedback that just feel delightful. Making player actions feel satisfying is my favourite thing to chase üòä.

I realize adding new sounds to the game runs a risk of adding a new source of annoyance for some players, so I'll be listening closely to all feedback
and likely iterating a bit more on some of these. I'm in no rush to get them into the main game until I'm sure they will be widely appreciated!

## How things are going

It's been a long time since the last major update, and honestly so far I'm really enjoying this healthier konkr-life balance. 
So expect updates to remain highly irregular going forward. That said, at the moment I'm planning to carve out a week or 
so in December for some focused konkr programming, so we'll see, things might happen üòâ.
