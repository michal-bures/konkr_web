**A major upgrade of AI defense capabilities is now released!** You should find your rivals to be less
recklessly aggressive, but also not quite as easy to outmaneuver anymore!
Many campaign levels got slightly updated and moved around to match their new difficulty level,
sorry for any confusion that might cause! 

Now I feel the main remaining weak point of the AI is attack planning, that will be my next focus!
