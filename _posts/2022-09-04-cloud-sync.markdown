**The cloud sync update is live!** If you'd like your campaign progress safely backed up and shared between your phone and PC, 
just click the little **‚öô** cogwheel icon in the top right corner and choose your preferred sign-in option!

You might also notice some additional UI changes, you can [read about those here](/update/2022/09/04/cloud-sync.html).

# UI Changes

- Fullscreen and toggles sound buttons were moved from top right to bottom right corner. Especially in the case of the fullscreen
 button I realized that's a more conventional place for it.
- Color palette toggle got moved to the settings menu in the new sidebar. Other configurable settings should be
landing in that section soon.
- Completed levels now show the starting state instead of the victory state on the level detail screen. As the level count will keep growing, I don't want to waste more and more space saving the final state of every level; the upside is that seeing the starting state is nicer when you are deciding if you want to replay a given level.
- The How to Play page and Feedback form found a new, more convenient home in the new sidebar menu. For the How to Play page, this is a first step towards expanding it into a more comprehensive source of information and tips.

Here's a neat little graphical summary, consider it my apology for moving stuff around under your hands. üòá

# Next up

I'd like to add support for multiple campaigns ASAP, but also can't wait to dig into
some AI and conquest mode improvements, so I guess we'll see what comes first! 

I have a very busy week coming up, so don't expect anything too groundbreaking coming over the next weekend üôÇ.
