Hey everyone, I would hate to keep you starved for content while
I'm working on the bigger improvements. So starting today, I'll be
 **adding 3 new handcrafted levels** to the campaign every week!

Today's batch includes new levels 8,9 and 10 as well as rebalancing of some existing ones. There's also a bunch of bugfixes and little improvements, more in the [changelog](/changelog). 

Also the <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSce99wG3nUVDI5WbqqvLCXgBGUVFJolhqvTwJOWmyWDDjoTNg/viewform?usp=sf_link">player survey</a></b> is still open,
big thanks to everyone who gave their feedback so far!
