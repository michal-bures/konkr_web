...and Happy new Year 2024! The expeditions update is now released together with some Christmas vibes. You can [read more about it all below](/update/2023/12/23/merry-christmas.html), or just go ahead and explore!

## Explore the world...

Aside of the new menus, a big difference with the expeditions system is that you now have to unlock new islands by progressing through the world map.

The old campaign was split into two large expeditions:
 - *Old World* contains the more classical and freeform levels that provide a more sandboxy, open-ended experience.
 - The more devious and puzzle-like levels are now in the aptly named *Islands of Pain* expedition. If you venture there,
don't say I didn't warn you 😈.

## ...or just unlock everything

If you're playing on a device where you can't save your progress, I realize the new islands unlocking system could be a massive problem for you!
That's why you can still unlock all levels via a new toggle in the options menu:

Alternatively, you can also bookmark this url, which will always start the game with everything unlocked: [https://www.konkr.io/?portable=1](https://www.konkr.io/?portable=1)

## To the next year of Konkr updates!

You might also notice some seasonal changes in the game, most notably the option to give presents 🎁 to your rivals! These are temporary, enjoy them while they last!

I'll probably take a break from development for the rest of the year, but I'm looking forward to tackle more of my ambitious plans with the game in 2024, I sense it will be a big year for Konkr 😉.

Thank you for bearing with me when the updates get slower, and for all the support and feedback you've given me this year! I hope you'll have a great holiday season, and I'll see you in 2024!

Take care of yourself, and if you can, someone else too. ❤️
