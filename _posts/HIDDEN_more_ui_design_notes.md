## About the current style of Konkr UI

I didn't start Konkr v2 with a clear vision of the UI, but some principles quickly emerged. I never really wrote them
down before, but here's my attempt at stating the three principal pillars:
- Minimalistic: Clean, smooth shapes, flat colors, thick outlines (no textures, gradients, shading)
- Precise, physical and playful, like a masterfully crafted wooden toy
- Medieval/Classical-era vibe, but only as a small accent to the modern minimalistic style

I designed the main in-game UI almost like a physical toy, with a bunch of moving parts and mechanisms that transform it
form state to state, and while that took a lot of tinkering, I'd say it was a resounding success! Almost everyone
I talk about the game mentions how pleasant and satisfying the UI is to interact with.

I originally tried to apply the same principles to the level select and title screen, but that turned out to be a hugely
intimidating task. I would love to follow in the footsteps of [Hearthstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axkPXCNjOh8)
with it's amazingly physical menus, but building whole menu screens like that is a huge undertaking and also once
it's built, it's really hard to expand and evolve.

With my limited time and skill, I couldn't make it work, so after a bunch of experimentation, I settled for what you
can see in the game now. The subdued blue/white shapes worked even without any textures or detail.
A very different take on the minimalistic aesthetic for sure, but it worked and combined nicely with
the light blue "ocean" background.

However, I've known for some time that I want to move past this approach. I want to make the game modes more immersive
and add more sense of progression and exploration between the levels. The featureless, cold blue/white UI just doesn't
facilitate that.
