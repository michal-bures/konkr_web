Hi everyone,
so ever since v2 was released about a month ago, I've been trying to collect as much feedback as I could. 

And it's been kind of amazing.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

### Sentimental rambling

After about a year of hacking away at this thing, seeing that I'm clearly not the only one who is utterly in love with the concept of this game is beyond rewarding.
Massive thank you to everyone that gave me feedback on this or the earlier version of Konkr.io over the past months (and years). You are my heroes, and I wouldn't make it this far without you â™¥.

This is also the first time that Konkr feels to me like a complete, finished game. There's no longer a laundry list of things I still *need to do* before It's truly fun and playable, and that feels awesome.

Of course, this does not mean I'm done! In fact I'm more excited than ever to keep expanding the game and bring it to the next level of greatness! But how does the next level of greatness look like is a somewhat open question now. I will share my thoughts below, but I would also love to know what *you* think. So if you didn't yet,
please do me a favor and <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSce99wG3nUVDI5WbqqvLCXgBGUVFJolhqvTwJOWmyWDDjoTNg/viewform?usp=sf_link">take this short survey</a></b>!

### The Paths Ahead

I've recently transformed my massive todo/idea list into a more high-level overview of the possible paths in which I could see the game expand next. Here it is!

<img src="/img/blog/what-next.png" alt="possible directions overview"/>

As you can see, I think the next big feature should be an option to login and save your progress in the cloud. 
I view this as a blocker for a lot of other exciting stuff, like a map editor and a big expansion of the campaign. 

Why? Currently, all your progress in the game is just stored in your browser. There are two big problems with that:
- it's really easy to lose all your progress by for example clearing your browser data.
- it's impossible to share your progress between devices (like your phone and a pc).

The current 20-level campaign is about the limit of the amount of content I'm willing to bet on such a flimsy storage mechanism. 
I really don't want you folks randomly losing many hours of progress!

So my main plan at the moment is:
1. get an (opt-in) login/cloud-sync in place
2. add a lot more campaign content
3. add map editor & map sharing

And after that, there's a sea of other cool improvements I could be working on.

All that said, the results of the survey posted above might still shake up things quite a bit, so stay tuned for more updates!

I hope this cleared things up a bit. Going forward I would like to be more transparent about my plans, rather than just dropping random 
updates on you folks out of the blue ðŸ˜‰.

Thanks for reading all the way through this! As always, I'm happy to chat about any of this with you [on the Discord server]({{ site.discord_link }}).
