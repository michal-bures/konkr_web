##  Merry Christmas

Looks like it's raining presents again in conquest mode!

<!-- excerpt-end -->

Have a pleasant holiday full of love and peace and happy new year 2026! For me, the past few months brought changes in career and personal life which I'm excited about and consequently not many changes in konkr, which is a shame. Even though the next few months will continue to be challenging, I would like to find more time to push things forward again. The game and the lovely community around it certainly deserves it! Until then, thanks for your support and patience!
